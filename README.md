# Night Time Light (Analysis of NASA VIIRS Images)
### The measure of 'NightTimeLight' has been in trend to detect the level of development of a country or region. Ample studies have proved that there is a categorical relationship between 'NightTimeLight' and the extent of economic activity. The introduction of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) dataset facilitated by NASA has made the analysis all the smoother and more effortless. Here, I am trying to identify if the 'much-hyped' development in Bangladesh is homogeneous or concentrated in some 'obvious' regions.
